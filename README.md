# TheMeanOnesBetterBladeTraps-7D2D


I always thought the blade traps were underpowered for what they should be. Thatâ€™s why TheMeanOnes Better Blade Traps Mod transforms blade traps into the true defensive powerhouses they deserve to be. This mod enhances the utility, durability, and destructive capability of blade traps, making them a much more valuable part of your base defense strategy in 7 Days to Die.
# Features:
# Increased Durability
Max Damage(HP) increased to 10,000 (from 5,000) for greater longevity in combat.
Enhanced explosion resistance and stability glue, ensuring traps can handle even the toughest hordes.
# Reduced Power Requirements
Required power is reduced to 15 watts (from 20 watts), making them more efficient for your electrical grid.
# Improved Offensive Power
Base Damage doubled to 40 (from 20), providing more lethal results against the undead.
Damage Received decreased to 3 (from 4), allowing them to withstand more hits before breaking.
# Smaller Footprint
MultiBlockDim adjusted to 1x1x1 (from 3x1x3), making placement more flexible and adaptable to compact base designs.
# Rebalanced Repair Costs
Repair costs reduced to 8 forged steel (from 10), streamlining maintenance requirements. When you have a base setup like mine with tons of these, it surely can get expensive to fix FAST after a Bloodmoon. 
# Economic Value Upgrade
Economic value increased to 600 (from 444), better reflecting their enhanced capabilities. 

# Why This Mod?
Blade traps in the vanilla game felt underwhelming for their cost and size. This mod rebalances the traps to provide the raw power and efficiency you expect from such an advanced base defense tool. Whether you're defending against relentless zombie waves or planning for the Blood Moon, TheMeanOnes Better Blade Traps Mod ensures your traps can handle the job. Oh, and did I mention, Its ServerSide Friendly?


# Upgrade your defenses and let the blades do the work!
